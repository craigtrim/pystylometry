I saw a small Zim-Zam sitting on a chair.
He sat and he sat with a stare and a glare.
“Why sit?” said the Zim-Zam. “Why not hop or hum?”
But the chair did not answer. The chair was quite dumb.

So up popped the Zim-Zam with a zip and a zap.
He flapped and he flipped and he fell in a lap.
Whose lap? Why, the lap of a tall Bim-Boo-Bee,
Who buzzed and who fussed and said, “Please don’t sit there, you see.”

They marched to the left. They marched to the right.
They marched through the morning and marched through the night.
Till tired they were of all marching about,
So they sat on the floor and they shouted, “We’re out!”

But then came a sound—was it plunk or was plop?
It came from a Thing with a wiggle-wiggle top.
“Don’t stop!” said the Thing. “Stopping’s no fun.
There’s running and jumping and thinking to be done!”

So off they all ran with a skip and a scoot,
Till thinking got tired and thinking said, “Shoot.”
And that was the end—yes, that was the end then,
Because even in stories, you must rest now and then.
